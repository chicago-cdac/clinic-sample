# clinic-sample

The goal of this repository is to be a central location for documenting and version controlling best practices for developing 11th Hour Data Science projects. When updating this repository the following principals should be followed: 
- Low overhead on developers: These repositories are often used by clinc students so tools used here should not require additional learning to use unless absolutely necessary.
- Up to date with best practices: The tools used here should adhere as closely as possible to modern and popular methods
- Justify decisions: Decisions should be justified so future collaborators can make informed decisions as conditions change
