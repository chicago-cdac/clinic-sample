## Project Background

## Project Goals


## Usage

{% if cookiecutter.docker == 'yes' %}### Docker

To run a script in docker, run:
```bash
make build-pipeline
make run-pipeline
```
To run a jupyter notebook in browser:
```bash
make build-notebooks
make run-notebooks
```

### Using Dev Container
To develop inside a container with VS Code (you can execute scripts and use jupyter notebooks within VS code in the docker container):

1. Open the repository in VS Code
1. At the bottom right a window may appear that says `Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file...`. If it does, select, `Reopen in Container` and you are done. Otherwise proceed to next step. 
1. Click the blue or green rectangle in the bottom left of VS code (should say something like `><` or `>< WSL`). Options should appear in the top center of your screen. Select `Reopen in Container`

To debug docker and connect interactively, you can use `make run-pipeline-bash`.

{% if cookiecutter.cluster == 'yes' %} ### Slurm
To open your repository with VS Code on the cluster login node, run `make run-ssh`. 
{% endif %}
